- [Modelerfour](https://github.com/Azure/autorest/blob/main/packages/extensions/modelerfour/CHANGELOG.md)

## Core: Change `json-path` resolution library

In this version we changed to use [jsonpath-plus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath-plus) instead of [jsonpath](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath) to resolve some high severity vulnerability warnings. `jsonpath-plus` should be a superset and add additional functionality. You can play with `jsonpath-plus` at https://jsonpath.com/

## Modelerfour: Added support for `uri` and `arm-id` string formats

A uri can now be represented using `format: uri`, this is the same behavior as `format: url`.

```yaml
type: string
format: uri
```

Added support for `arm-id` which will produce a `ArmIdSchema`

```yaml
type: string
format: arm-id
```

## Modelerfour: Improvement to same naming errors

`Name is empty` error should be imoproved and easier to diagnose.
